New based C# API Wrapper for Discord. Originally known as ModCore.Common.Discord, made available for everyone to use ðŸ˜˜

## In Development
BasedCord is currently in active development. In most cases, it should not be ready for general use yet, but it is possible to get a PoC bot working in it.

## Why use BasedCord instead of other libraries?
Look, I'm not the boss of you. You can use whatever you want. But is there any Discord API library that actively advertises itself to be the "based" option? Didn't think so. It's your choice compadre. Either be based or be cringe. I know what I'd choose...

## Getting a development environment ready
1. Dry scoop a shot of pre-workout and do 47 pushups
2. Git clone the repository
3. Open it with Visual Studio
