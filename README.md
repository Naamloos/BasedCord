New based C# API Wrapper for Discord. Originally known as ModCore.Common.Discord, made available for everyone to use ðŸ˜˜

## In Development
BasedCord is currently in active development. In most cases, it should not be ready for general use yet, but it is possible to get a PoC bot working in it. All of the library and even this README is prone to breaking changes.

## Why use BasedCord instead of other libraries?
Really, you can use whatever you want. But is there any Discord API library that actively advertises itself to be the "based" option? Didn't think so. It's ultimately your choice, compadre! Either be based or be cringe. Just so you know, I already know what I'd choose...

Be wary that there is little to no handholding in this library. The library provides a bare minimum of tools to get started (with the exception of extensions), so a certain level of familiarity with Discord's API is to be expected. 

You are expected to build your own entities using the provided classes, and really it is up to you to confirm the data you're sending to Discord is correct. Luckily, in most cases Discord's API tells you exactly what fields you sent incorrectly.

TL;DR: This library is not at all beginner friendly, but provides a great deal of control, with the exception that Microsoft's hosting extensions and dependency injection are a requirement, not an optional feature.

## Getting a development environment ready
1. Dry scoop a shot of pre-workout and do 47 pushups
2. Git clone the repository
3. Open it with Visual Studio
